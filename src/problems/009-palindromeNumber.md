### Problem Statement:
Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is palindrome integer.

An integer is a **palindrome** when it reads the same backward as forward.

- For example, `121` is a palindrome while `123` is not.

### Example 1:
**Input:** x = 121  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation:** 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

### Example 2:
**Input:** x = -121  
**Output:** false  
**Explanation:** From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore, it is not a palindrome.

### Brute Force Solution:
For the brute force approach, we can convert the integer to a string, and then compare the string with its reverse. If they are the same, the number is a palindrome.

#### TypeScript Code:
```typescript
function isPalindromeBruteForce(x: number): boolean {
    const str = x.toString();
    const reversedStr = str.split('').reverse().join('');
    return str === reversedStr;
}
```

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of digits in the integer. This is because converting an integer to a string and reversing it both take linear time.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of digits in the integer. This space is used to store the string representation of the number.

### Better Solution:
A more efficient solution involves reversing only half of the number and comparing it with the other half. If the two halves are equal, the number is a palindrome. This avoids the need to convert the integer to a string.

#### TypeScript Code:
```typescript
function isPalindrome(x: number): boolean {
    // Edge cases: when x < 0, it's not a palindrome.
    // Also, if the last digit of the number is 0, to be a palindrome,
    // the first digit of the number also needs to be 0, which can only happen if x is 0.
    if(x < 0 || (x % 10 === 0 && x !== 0)) {
        return false;
    }

    let reversedHalf = 0;
    while(x > reversedHalf) {
        reversedHalf = reversedHalf * 10 + x % 10;
        x = Math.floor(x / 10);
    }

    // When the length of the number is odd, we can get rid of the middle digit by reversedHalf/10
    // For example, in the case of 12321, at the end of the loop we will have x = 12, reversedHalf = 123,
    // since the middle digit doesn't matter in palindrome(it will always equal to itself), we can safely remove it.
    return x === reversedHalf || x === Math.floor(reversedHalf / 10);
}
```

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n), where `n` is the number of digits in the integer. This is because we're processing half of the digits in the integer.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we're using a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.

This approach efficiently checks if a number is a palindrome without using additional space for string conversions, making it a better solution, especially for large numbers.
